-> it is coming at run time
-> how many type of exception:
1. Checked Exception
2. Unchecked Exception
-> WHAT IS CHECKED EXCEPTION?
--->Exception which extends to a class Exception directly
    IOException
    SQLException
    InterruptedException
--->In case of checked Exception writing of try-catch or throws is compulsory.
-> WHAT IS UNCHECKED EXCEPTION?
--->Exception which extends to a class called RuntimeException
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Arithmetic Exception:
    1. 10/0 : object created inside the JVM -> Looks for the try,catch -> object is back in JVM for handling
             -> inside the catch method printStackTrace() method is called ()
    2. 10.0/0 : infinity
    3. 10.0f/0 : infinity
    4. -10.0/0 : -infinity
    5. 0.0/0 : NaN
-> Note: Throwable -> Exception -> RuntimeException -> ArithmeticException
-> Advantage of try Catch : When the Exception occurs in try block control stops.
                            And then after catch block remaining statements will also execute.
-> Note: Exception to be written in the last.Not at the beginning.
-> Throw Keyword : -> OOPs.This keyword is used to throw System defined Exception.
                   -> In case of user defined exception is also ours.
-> Finally block : -> OOPs.This is a block which can executed even if we are having an Exception or not.
--> Throws : when a method is capable of causing an exception.
    but it does not handle than write 'throws' and type of exception against the method name.
    so that we can handle the exception art the column
-->Throws IOException - Checked
-->Throws ArithmeticException - no try-catch -> unChecked
