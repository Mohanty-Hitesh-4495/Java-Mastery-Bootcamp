* Inheritance is of 5 types: 1.Single inheritance
                             2.Hierarchical inheritance
                             3.Multilevel inheritance
                             4.Multiple inheritance
                             5.Hybrid inheritance
* Advantage of Inheritance: 1.Code Reusability / Redundancy of code.
                            2.Number of objects are less in heap area.
                            3.As the lines are reduced, the compilation time is less.
                            4.Method Overriding can be used for version control of the software.
Question: what you should do?
>> Make a child class VC1 then keep  the same method
>> In those types class we use inheritance

/*
 **********************INHERITANCE WITH A CONSTRUCTOR***********************
  >>> Inheritance with (parameterized,parameterless,default) constructor.
  >>> Inheritance with a block.
  >>> block always executed before a constructor and method.
*/
/*  Question: Where a block can be used?
    Answer: A block can be used for the dynamic value initialisation.
    Question: What is Polymorphism?
    Question: Types of Polymorphism
    Answer: >Method overloading:
            *In class there can be more than one method having same name but different signature.
            *Method Location is same class but signature is different.
            *Example: int to Ascci value.(datatype can be changed in method calling in different class through object)
            >Method overriding:
            *There can be more than one method having same name with same signature.
            *Method Location is Different class.
